# About
Bulltricker is a French board game similar to both Chess and Checkers but with an original twist.
## Disclaimer
The game idea, models and rules are all reserved rights to their originator, David Jonca. This source code is of course free to take and edit as you see fit for personal use, but note that the repository doesn't have any license (See what that implies [here](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/)).
## Compiling & Running
Both an already compiled executable and a Makefile are included within the project.
## How To Play
Translated instructions are available within the game. But if you speak French, you're welcome to check the original, official text.
## Updates
The code part related to piece movement has some serious spaghetti code in it and will probably be refactored at some point. Other than that, no updates will be made for this version.

However, a full scale online version is in development, with the agreement of its originator, and is soon to be released for WINDOWS/LINUX/MAC and Mobile.
